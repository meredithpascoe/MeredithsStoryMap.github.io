The spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) is a species of true owl found throughout British Columbia and the Western United States. Although spotted owls can be found in a variety of hardwood and coniferous forest habitats, they perfer to nest in the tree hollows of old-growth forests. There are three subspecies of spotted owls, including the northern spotted owl, the Mexican spotted owl, and the California spotted owl. The latter primarily resides in the state of California and can be identified by its medium size, lighter brown color, and larger spots. Beginning in the 1990s, the California spotted owl found itself thrust into the spotlight due to logging debates between lumberers and conservationists. This is because the old-growth forests where they make their homes are also a lucrative natural resource, providing thousands of jobs in the timber industry. As a result, the California spotted owl is currently listed as a Sensitive Species by the U.S. Forest Service and its populations continue to dwindle.

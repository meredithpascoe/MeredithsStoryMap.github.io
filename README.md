## Story Map

The story map created for this lab details the threats faced by the California spotted owl.

The spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) is a species of true owl found throughout British Columbia and the Western United States. They are currently listed as a Sensitive Species by the U.S. Forest Service due to threats they have faced from the lumber industry and other owl species. 

I chose to do my story map on this topic because I am passionate about environmentalism and conservation efforts. One of the main issues faced by the California Spotted Owl is in regards to the logging inudstry denouncing it's conservation because they value the economy more.
